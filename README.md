# Quiz Platform README

Welcome to the Quiz Platform project! This web application provides a platform for users to take quizzes on various subjects. The project is divided into a client-side and a server-side component.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a comprehensive quiz platform that allows users to sign up, log in, take quizzes, review quiz results, and manage courses and questions.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS: Frontend framework for building the client-side application.
- Material-UI (MUI): React components for implementing a Material Design-based UI.
- PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing quiz data.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
- Express.js: Web framework for building RESTful APIs and server-side logic.

## Installation

To run the Quiz Platform locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mohdaahad/quiz.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd quiz`
3. Install dependencies:
   - For the client:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm install
     ```
   - For the server:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm install
     ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start the development server for both the client and server components.

1. Start the client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
    ```
2. Start the Server:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start
    ```

The client will be accessible at http://localhost:3000, and the server will be running at http://localhost:8081 by default.
